# Designing a Serverless Blog in AWS
You're tasked with designing a serverless web app in AWS, which hosts a blog. The website will:

- Primarily host static content
- Require user accounts/logins
- Users will be able to add comments to blog posts
- Users can also retrieve content via an API
- Users can sign up for email notifications that are sent when a new blog post is published
- Users can also sign up for daily email digests of new content

Describe the architecture you would use to build this web app. Include the AWS services you would use and how they would interact with each other.
